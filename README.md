# HTS-basic-missions
This repository contains solutions to the first 3 basic missions on hackthissite.org.

Basic 1: It says a bit of HTML knowledge is required. So, if you look carefully in the page source you can find the password.
Basic 2: Since Network Security Sam forgot to upload the password file, a blank password field suffices to complete the mission.
Basic 3: This time Sam uploaded the password file in the form of a PHP file(but without encrypting it).Opening that file gives the answer.
